There are my rough notes which i noted when reading Kivy source code. 

app.py is the entry point and App class should be inherited in your code to run your kivy app.

App class methods:
	run:
          this method is will call build() method in order to get the root if you have not overrided the build () method 
          in your code then it will take Widget object as root. It will call method load_kv() which will automaticall find
          your .kv file by using the class name in our source code. load_kv will then call load_file() in Builder class which is 		  in lang.py then it will handover the data to parser which will parse the data and return root widget will will have 
 	 all the widgets in it and in lang.py there is a check which will allow only one root. 
		Build method / load_kv method will return/ set root element. Builder will do if dont inherit this method or dont have 
         root widget in .kv file
         we can even directly load the .kv file by calling load_file from Builder
	Cool we can even add our class to root and we can define rule for that class by <>:
